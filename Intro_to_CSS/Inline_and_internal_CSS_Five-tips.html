                        Before &nbsp;&nbsp; we start the DBMS Tutorial, we need to have a clear insight into what Databases are. 
                        Let us say that you&apos;'re working in a corporation where there are about a million employees scattered across the globe. 
                        Every employee will have a Unique Employee ID, a job role, a manager who the employee is working under,
                        a &apos;hire&apos; date and a &apos;termination of contract&apos; date, and a particular amount of salary.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Now it is not impossible to make tables, categorize the data, write a million entries down into one long sheet of paper,
                        but it is rather unethical. 
                        This is why Databases officially came into existence in the 1960s.

                                All of us have heard of Spreadsheets.
                                It lets us create tables, enter data, perform calculations on the data in the cells,
                                and write mathematical functions. 
                                You can also maintain multiple worksheets, relate the data 
                                amongst the worksheets, even during calculation.
                                So why not use just spreadsheets then? Why rely on SQL commands to 
                                operate on the same tabular data using a Relational DBMS? Since both 
                                works on tabular data, people think that they are interchangeable, 
                                but it is not so.
